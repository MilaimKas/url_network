# User Journey Network Visualization

This project visualizes user journey networks using Flask (backend) and Cytoscape.js (frontend). It simulates or loads user navigation data, builds a network graph, and provides an interactive dashboard for exploration.

It is a prototype that is thought as a collaborative project between data scientists and web developers to create a tool for analyzing user journeys on websites or applications.

## Features
- Interactive network visualization (Cytoscape.js)
- Device and network type filtering
- Shortest path highlighting between nodes
- Weight threshold slider for edge filtering
- Hover tooltips for nodes and edges
- time dependent visualization of network metrics

## Setup
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-caching pandas numpy networkx scipy
   ```
2. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## File Structure
- `app.py` - Flask backend serving the API and dashboard
- `app_helpers/` - Helper modules for data and network logic (backend)
- `static/` - Frontend files (HTML, JS, CSS)

## Customization
- Adjust data generation or connect to real data in `app_helpers/get_data.py`
- Modify network logic in `app_helpers/network_class.py`
- Update frontend UI in `static/dashboard.html` and `static/network_logic.js`

## LLM usage
This project was developed with the assistance of OpenAI's GPT-4 and 5. The frontend code, in particular, was almost entirely generated by the model based on the requirements provided (I have only limited knowledge in js or html). The python-based backend code, in contrast, was almost entirely written by me, with the model providing suggestions and improvements upon request.
